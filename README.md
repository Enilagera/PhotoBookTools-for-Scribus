# PhotoBookTools-for-Scribus

‘PhotoBook Tools’ is a collection of scripts and tricks intended to create photo album pages in a fast and flexible way with Scribus. Please read the ‘Instructions’-file for installation and use!

Summary of workflow:
1) ‘PhotoBookLayoutMaker’-script generates image frame layouts (you can save them in the Scrapbook for future use).
2) Insert images in bulk into your image frames.
3) ‘PhotoBookFillFramesCentered’-script performs automatically a maximal fill of the selected image frames. If needed you can manually adjust.
4) ‘PhotoBookImageCropResize’-script will crop your images to the image frames and resize them to the desired dpi (reduction of file size).
5) Edit caption texts (if you have created them in step 1).
6) Export your photo book to pdf or other formats.
